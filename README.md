 EVEN THE IMPLICATION THAT EITHER THE AUTHORS OR THE PROFESSOR HAVE SAID, KNOW,
 SHOULD KNOW, OR AGREE WITH ANY WORDS PROVIDED.


* When people collaborate, there will be conflicts.
* CS is not physics. There is no Bible telling people what to do. All designs face TRADE-OFFs.
* People write articles to express what lessons they learned. Not only results but the insights why we get results should be included.
* (About ALOHAnet) Simple systems used to be robust.
* (About OSI) Trials & Errors vs Thought Design.
* (About hICN) People tend to use mature systems. And you cannot ask all end-users speak your protocol. Thus, the battlefield of NDN is edge computing, not CDN.
* (About ndn-repo) Do not generalize. We shouldn't invent requirements.
* (About subnet) What's changed is not the format but interpreting, given the fact all devices had implemented the format.
* (About IPv6) The market is not going to spend a single penny when the existing system works.
* I know Sunday is Sunday, but graduate students work on Sunday.
* You cannot simply say the compatibility is important without inspecting why.
* Proof of authority only proves you are you, without proving that you are honest.
* There are always intuitions in protocol design, but not proofs.
* Do not use any hardware-based examples in protocol specification, because hardware changes too fast.
* (Self Interests in blockchain)
    - In peer-to-peer scenario, there is always a question to be settled: "Why should I help you?"
    - If I have to do this, what's the benefit?
* Writing down a problem is half of a paper. You wirte down the difficulty and people will pay attention to that. The industry people need to know what need to be improved.
* Don't plan to do writing later. Later your thought is going to fade.
* Congestion is something abnormal. That's why I dislike congestion control fairness. The network is not always congeted and the complex mechanism itself becomes a factor of attack.
* (About security) Whatever protocol you use, you must start with something shared.
* (Junxiao said that) Sleep is No.1, I agree.
* (About paper writing) When you don't have time to write a short one, write a long one.
* There are two kinds of constraints: physical limitation and artifacts of today's product. Point out which.
* (Routing protocol)
    - Routing & forwarding is the essence of networking - how we deliver from anyone to anyone.
    - Every node is blind. They can't see anything. That's why they always chat.
* An address is a special case of a name only given to interfaces. A name is its generalization which is given to everything.
* Slow start is a golden rule for everything.
* (Application driven)
    - If you only write papers, you won't know whether it actually works.
    - Academic guys do systematic stydies and operators solve problems (in a quick and dirty way), so there are so many "Operators' Hack" today.
* NDN doesn't promise security, but it offers blocks to build a secure system.
* Human by its nature is overly generalized, not good for system design.
* It's the end-users but not big companies who control the future. That's why Internet and Ethernet are not killed.
* Read books. You really should learn knowledge from the history.
* Paper is a byproduct.
* If you want to convinse the reviewers, convince yourself first.
* Write a paper in the eyes of readers. Don't just say what you want to talk.
* (HOSTS.TXT) One thing human definitely do is making errors. So there's a very important problem: who's in charge of what.
* For each successful thing, know what factors lead to its success.
* Performance is the result of operations, not design.
    - How could you measure the speed when you are designing the upper protocol, without even knowing the connection under it?
* But I'll tell you the whole Internet lives on our own money. The aggregation doesn't work that much today.
* (About DNSSEC)
    - You should ask "Where things go wrong?"
    - The real world is not simply Alice talking to Bob.
    - In that days people know nothing about "immutable data".
